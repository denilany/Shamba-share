# Shamba-share

## Introduction
Shamba-share is a platform that connects small-scale farmers with lands available for lease at an affordable price. This project aims to enhance the confidence of farmers by partnering with the Ministry of Lands, ensuring access to verified lands without the worry of being defrauded. We prioritize safe transactions of funds from the farmer to the landowner through thorough verification processes.
